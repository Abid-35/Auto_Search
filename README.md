#  Bulk Search Automation

This script uses `pyautogui` to automate the process of opening the Edge browser (or any app with name starting with `'ed'`), performing a batch of searches using a predefined list of search terms, and interacting with the interface by simulating mouse and keyboard actions.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Opens the **Start Menu** and searches for an app starting with `'ed'` (typically Microsoft Edge).
- Launches the app.
- Types search terms one by one from two predefined lists (`s` and `ser`).
- Simulates mouse and keyboard actions:
  - Double-clicks a specific screen coordinate
  - Selects all content with `Ctrl + A`
- Closes the application with `Alt + F4` at the end.
